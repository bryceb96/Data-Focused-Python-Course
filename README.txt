This homework focused on parsing through the NYMEX SPAN file that we were provided with, which contained thousands of futures and option contracts.
I was tasked with only retrieving files that were of type "B" or type "81" records before December 2023 and after November 2020 and then output the results in two tables, one for future contracts and option contracts, to a external text file.
Please note that I was not allowed to use any panda Python functions as the class would cover those in later weeks, so I had to format the data into tables using the print.format method.
Also the original SPAN file I parsed through was about 137,000 KB which was too large to upload to GitHub.
Enjoy!
