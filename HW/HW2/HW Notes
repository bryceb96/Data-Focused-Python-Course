- Goal: extract the settlement prices and contract expiration dates for WTI Crude Oil

- CME Globex Product Code: CL (necessary for scanning the SPAN file)
- read in the cme file and output the data to a CL_expirations and settlements txt file with the data sorted into columns in a table
* - see if I can improve the runtime after completing the assignment

Algorithm:
1. Copy the file to make sure it can output to the txt file [Done]
2. alter program to copy only the type B and type 8 records to the txt file [Done]
  Algorithm:
  - copy in file to fin
  - make an empty list for type B and type 8
  - search for the type of B records
  for line in file:
  if type == "B"
  - input B record into the type B list
  else if type == "8"
  - input 8 record into the type 8 list
  else
  continue
  [will have a O(n) time since it is going through the entire list*]
3. alter to only copy the type B CL and type 8 CL records [Done]
4. alter program to display type B CL and type 8 CL records for the top half of the first table (Futures code, contract month, contract type, contract month and futures exp date)
  - then work on the bottom half of first table (options code, contract type(call/put), contract month, and then options exp date) [Done]
5. alter program to display the second table for type 81 records [Done]
  - first half: (futures code, contract month, contract type, and settlement price)
  - then display second half: (call option, put option, product code, product type code, option strike price, then settlement price)
